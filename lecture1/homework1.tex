\maketitle

Choose a security problem that you are interested in. Create a system-level diagram of the problem as demonstrated in class. Be prepared to present your work at the beginning of next class.

Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Systems are not processes! A process can be thought of as a path {\it through} a system. The implication here is that there should be no element of ordering or time involved in your systems diagram.
\end{enumerate}
